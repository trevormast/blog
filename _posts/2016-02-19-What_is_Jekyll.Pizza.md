#Why Jekyll.Pizza?

Recently, I decided to start blogging in order to test my coding skills and to give back to the coding community from whom I had learned so much. Having heard about Jekyll's simplicity and coder-friendly interface, I gave it a try. Unfortunately, the startup process was much more complicated than I had expected. Though I was eventually able to build a site and enjoy all of Jekyll's wonderful capabilities, I was disturbed by the disparity between Jekyll's ease of use and difficulty of starting up. At first I thought that my difficulties were unique, but a quick search revealed that others had run into issues with Jekyll as well.

In need of a new project, and excited for the possibility of making something I love even better, I resolved to automate the startup process and align it with the simplicity for which Jekyll is known. 

#Jekyll Blogs... Even Faster.
