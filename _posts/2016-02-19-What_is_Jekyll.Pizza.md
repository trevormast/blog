# Jekyll.Pizza: The New Standard For Jekyll Blogs
Jekyll.Pizza is a Ruby web application designed to simplify the process of starting a [Jekyll][:jekyll-home] blog.  [Github][:github] users can sign in, enter basic information about their blog, and (almost) instantly have a blog hosted by Github Pages. 


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
